# POROTECH AUGMENT STATS (LIGMA LIBRARY)

## INTRODUCTION
* This program/site was developed as a response to Riot Games' initial policy, which prohibited the publication of augment stats derived from their API game data. The policy has since been reversed as a response to this site.

## CORE FUNCTIONALITY
* Web Scraping: Uses Python and the Beautiful Soup library to scrape data from lolchess.gg, targeting top 100 players.
* Database Management: Uses Google Cloud SQL to manage and store scraped data.
* Frontend-Backend Communication: Leverages a Heroku PHP intermediary to allow the frontend to access the SQL database.
